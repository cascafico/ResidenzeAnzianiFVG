## geocoding RAFVG dataset
Most important and frequent adjustments are on address field: Nominatim geocoder needs precision in street names and agreed housenumber separators. After standardizin addresses, Nominatim query has been composed.

## other operations
Adjustments on phone/fax format and quotes removal also.

Due to the limited size (189) of the dataset, a manual import has been planned by use of a dedicated umap.
